# SubDamian
Surrogate-based Data Mining Analysis (in development)

## Features
- ML/AI-based surrogate models
- Data fusion approaches for multi-fidelity data
- Optimization coupling with trained surrogate models

## Example results
- LF: only low-fidelity data is used for training
- MF: both low- and mid-fidelity data is used
- HF: all data including low-, mid-, and high-fidelity data is used
- HF only: only high-fidelity data is used
